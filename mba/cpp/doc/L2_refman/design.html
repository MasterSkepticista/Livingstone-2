<title>Basic Functionality of L2</title>

<h1>Basic Functionality of L2</h1>

Consider the following problem. We are given a set of variables and a
set of constraints on those variables.  Each constraint is a restriction 
on the way the variables may be assigned. A subset of the variables are
marked as assumptions.  We may change the value of assumptions as we
see fit.  Given an assignment to some of the variables, our task is to
find an assignment to the assumptions so that none of the constraints
are violated.  This is the basic functionality of the L2 software.

<p>

When we use L2, the assumption variables will be related to the states
of devices in a physical system.  For example, we might assume that a
valve in a hydraulic system has stuck open, or that it is operating
normally and is closed.  We are free to make either assumption and see
how it effects the constraints.  Other variables will represent other
quantities such as the fluid flow through the valve.  The constraints
will capture a description of each device we are modeling.  For
example, the constraints would capture the relationship that when the
valve is closed, the fluid flow through the valve is zero.  This
constraint restricts what values we can assign to the assumption
variable representing the valve state, given a value for the fluid
flow.  If we were to assign the valve state assumption variable to
closed, the constraint would require the fluid flow variable to have
the value zero.  If the fluid flow value were assigned to a non-zero
value, L2 would be forced to change the value of the assumption
variable to stuck closed.  This is the basic operation of L2: assign
certain variables (namely observations of conditions from a set of
devices, and the commands sent to the devices) to known values, then
search for an assignment to the assumption variables that result in
no constraints being violated.  The assumptions then represent a
consistent belief about the state of the devices (that is, a diagnosis
or state estimate).

<p>

A simple schematic of how the L2 functionality is implemented is shown
below.  We will refine the diagram as we add detail.  A database is
provided to store the users's constraints and definitions of the
problem's variables and their types.  The collection of constraints
and variables is often called the <i>theory</i>. The user may also
make assignments to variables (e.g. setting the valve flow to zero).
Once these assignments are made, a search procedure makes assignments
to the assumption variables in the database.  The database notifies
the search procedure if the assignments is has made are consistent
with the constraints and the user-supplied assignments.  If not, the
search procedure makes a different assignment.  The database makes use
of a consistency checker that checks an assignment for consistency
with a set of constraints.

  | Assignments  |  Consistency flag

 +---------------------+ 
 | consistency checker |
 +---------------------+ 
</pre>

<p>
A simple extension to this picture is cost.  If more than one
assignment to the assumption variables is consistent, which should be
chosen?  By giving a cost to each value each assumption variable can
be assigned, we create a criteria the search procedure can use to
guide its search.  The search procedure might define the cost of the
assignment to all of the assumption variables as the sum or product of
the cost of assignment to each of the assumption variables.  The
search procedure might search for the highest or lowest cost
consistent assignment, depending upon what the cost represents in the
problem.  In L2 applications, the cost typically represents the prior
probability of the failure that an assignment to the assumption
variable represents (e.g. that the valve is stuck open).  Adding cost
to the assumption assignments doesn't significantly change the flow
diagram shown above.  It simply means the variable definitions must
include cost information for every value of every assumption variable,
and the search procedure must be able to request this information from
the database.  We won't include this in the illustration.

<p>
The illustration above could describe a whole family of software
systems designed to find the best-cost assignment that satisfies a set
of constraints.  We will now specialize this to the kinds of
constraints and consistency checks that are currently implemented in
L2.  The diagram below illustrates the kind of constraint
satisfication available in L2.  Again, we will add detail in a
subsequent diagram after explaining this diagram.

</pre>

<p>
The L2 database currently accepts only variables of finite domain,
similar to enumerations in programming languages.  Each variable is
only able to take on a finite number of distinct values.  That is, the
variable <b>flow </b> may have values <i>{zero, non-zero}</i>,
<i>{low, medium, high}</i> or <i>{zero, below10, below20, below30,
above30 }</i>.  A variable may not have an infinite range of values,
such as the integers or the real numbers.

<p>
Constraints concern the equality of the values of variables.  The
simplest type of constraint is an equality between a variable and a
value or between two variables.  If <b>flow1</b> and <b>flow2</b> are
variables of domain <i>{low, medium,high}</i> then "flow1=high" and
"flow1=flow2" are valid simple constraints.  The simple constraint
"flow1!=high" specifies that the value of <b>flow1</b> can be any
value except high.  Logical connectors such as AND, OR and IMPLIES can
be used to combine simple constraints.  For example, we might wish to
express the constraint "valve1=open IMPLIES flow1=high" or
"valve1=open OR flow1=low".  We provide an object-oriented modeling
language for introducing variables and constraints, described 
<a href="../jmpl/intro_to_jmpl.html">here</a>.

<p>
As in the more general case above, we must defined our variables,
assignment costs, and constraints. We may then set some assignments
and allow the search procedure can begin setting the assumption
variable values in the attempt to find the best cost set of 
assumption values that are consistent.  In order to speed the search,
we add an additional feature to the consistency checker, the ability
to identify conflicts between assumption values.  Simply put, a
conflict is a set of assignments to assumption variables that, when
made, causes the database to infer two inconsistent values for the
same variable.  Any assignment the search procedure chooses for the
assumptions that includes a conflict will again infer those
inconsistent values.  The conflicts can therefore be used to guide the
search procedure to avoid many assignments that are inconsistent.
<p>
For example, suppose we have two valves connected in series, plus a
number of other devices. Our assumptions will include the state of the
two valves, plus the state of the other devices. Our constraints might
include "valve1=closed IMPLIES flow1=zero" and "valve2=closed IMPLIES
flow1=zero".  That is, if either valve is closed, flow stops.  Suppose
the user assigns "flow1=high".  Also suppose the first assignment the
search procedure assigns includes "valve1=closed" and "valve2=closed".
Based on the two constraints above, the database is able to infer
"flow1=zero".  This is in conflict with the assignment
"flow1=high".  The consistency checker traces back through the
constraints used to infer the two conflicting values.  The
value "flow1=high" was assigned by the user and involves no assumptions.
The value "flow1=zero" was inferred by the assumption assignments
"valve1=closed" and "valve2=closed".  The set,  
<i>{"valve1=closed", "valve2=closed"}</i> is returned by the
consistency checker as a conflict.  A smart search procedure will not
consider any assignments that includes both of these values.
If we have many assumptions other than the valve states, this can have
the effect of ruling out a huge number of combinations of assumptions.

<h1>Implementation of the Basic Functionality</h1>

The class hierarchy for this section is 
<a href="./conflict_db/inherits.html">here</a>.

<h2>The Conflict_db class</h2>

The conflict_db class implements the database described above.  It
allows the user to create variables of finite domains and
equality-based constraints involving variables and values.  It allows
the user make assignments to variables and query if the current set of
assignments are consistent with the constraints.

<p>
The conflict_db supports two classes of variables, assignable and
dependent. Assignable variables may be assigned.  Dependent variables 
have their value supplied via the constraints and the assignable
variables.  A subclass of the assignable variables are the
assumptions.  These are the assignable variables that a search
procedure may modify in order to make the theory (the collection of
variables and constraints) consistent.  When a variable is created, it
must be specified as either dependent, assignable, or assumption.
For an assumption, we must also supply the cost (usually interpretted
as prior probability) of each value in the domain of the variable and
a default value.  The default will be assigned before the search
procedure assigns a value.
<p>
In addition to creating finite domains and variables, the conflict_db
can be used to create constraints, assign values to assignable and
assumption variables, and check for consistency.  If the theory is
inconsistent, the conflict_db reports the conflicting assumption set
(a conflict).  In addition, all conflicts that have been discovered 
are stored in the conflict_db for use by search procedures.
<p>
Much of the functionality presented in the Conflict_db is implemented
in a propositional inference system, the LTMS class.  In order to make
use of the LTMS class, the Conflict_db casts the functionality it
provides on variables of finite domain into queries on a propositional
theory.  

<h3>Conversion to a Propositional Theory</h3>

The conflict_db class determines the consistency of a set of
assignments and constraints by converting them to a propositional
theory.  A propositional theory consists of a set of propositions
(items that may be either true or false) and a set of clauses.  Each
clause constrains which sets of propositions may be true
simultaneously.  Each proposition represents the truth or falsehood of
a variable having a specific value.  A clause represents a disjunction
(OR) of propositions or negated propositions.  In order for the clause
to be satisfied, a proposition it contains must be true, or a negated
proposition it constains must be false.  After being created, a clause
may be deleted.  In this case, it still exists, but is temporarily
suspended and does not constrain its propositions.  If a deleted
clause is added, it again constrains its propositions.
<p>
To represent a new variable, the conflict_db creates a set of
propositions and clauses that represent the possible assignments to
the variable. For example, if the variable <b>flow </b> may have
values <i>{zero, non-zero}</i>, the conflict_db creates a proposition
"flow=zero" and a proposition "flow=non-zero" to represent the
possible values.  To ensure that flow never takes on more than one
value, the conflict_db creates a clause of the form <i>NOT "flow=zero"
OR NOT "flow=non-zero"</i>.  To represent that flow always has a value
(regardless of whether or not we can infer what it is), it also
creates a clause of the form <i>"flow=zero" OR "flow=non-zero"</i>.
For assignable variables, the conflict_db also creates a clause
containing the proposition that represents each value of the variable.
That is, for flow, we have a clause containing only the proposition
"flow=zero".  In order for this clause to be satisfied, the
proposition "flow=zero" is forced to be true.  These clauses allow us
to represent the assignment of a value to a variable by the user or
search procedure.   Temporarily adding this type of clause forces the
variable to have a value.  Deleting the clause unconstrains the value.
<p>
In addition to the clauses created to represent the variables, the
user can create clauses that constrain the possible assignments to the
variables.  For example, the constraint "valve1=open OR flow1=low" is
converted to a clause between the propositions representing the two
value assignments in the constraint.  There are simple logical
transformations for representing OR, AND, IMPLIES, IF and so on.  
<p>
The Conflict_db class uses the LTMS class to create propositions and
clauses, add and delete clauses, determine consistency, and find
conflicts. 

<h2>LTMS methods required to support the Conflict_db class</h2>

The LTMS class implements a propositional inference system with truth
maintenance capabilities.  It performs unit propagation.  
The LTMS must support the following methods in order to support
the basic L2 functionality.  Additional methods for temporal
functionality are described below. For detail, see 
<a href="tms/class_ltms.html">LTMS documentation</a>

<ul>
<p><li> create_proposition (int time_step=0) <br>
     Creates a new proposition with the passed time step (see below).
     This is currently implemented as get_proposition(name,time),
     which finds or creates a proposition of  the passed name.  We
     do not need to store the names of propositions in the LTMS.
     
<p><li> create_clause (  void * datum,  Slist< Proposition *>& positive,  
                      Slist< Proposition *>& negative,  bool vol,   bool in_theory,   unsigned int time_step = 0 )  <br>
      Creates a clause (a disjunction of positive and negative propositions).

<p><li>  void delete_clause(Clause)<br>
      Pulls the previously created out of the theory.  The clause
      still exists in the LTMS, but it no longer constrains the
      propositions it contains.

<p><li>  void add_clause(Clause) <br>
      Puts the previously created clause into the theory.  The clause
      now constrains the propositions it contains.

<p><li>  bool propagate(void) <br>
      Performs propositional inference.  Returns True if the theory is
      consistent, False if it is inconsistent.  

<p><li>  void last_conflict(Slist<Clause>, bool (*predicate)(Clause))<br>   
      
      If the theory is inconistent, this method returns the conflict
      causing the inconsistency.

      If the theory is consistent, this method does
      nothing. Otherwise, it finds one of the clauses that was found
      to be unsatisfied.  Intuitively, the truth values we have
      inferred for the propositions of the clause are such that
      the clause can never be satisifed.  Thus, those truth values
      cannot all co-exist and they are in conflict.   Rather than
      simply returning those propositions, we trace back to the
      clauses that constrained those propositions to have their
      current values.  We can then trace the propositions in that
      clause, and so on.   This method traces back through the
      chain of inference that allowed it to infer the unsatisfying
      truth values of the unsatisfied clause, collecting up each
      clause that returns T from proposition.

      Note: This is used by the conflict_db to find a conflict in terms
      of those clauses that represent assumption assignments.  Conflict_db
      indicates this by attaching the assignment object to the clause
      in the clause's datum slot.  Conflict_db then calls this method
      with a predicate that looks in the datum slot and checks for an assignment.
</ul>   

<h1>Adding Temporal Functionality to L2</h1>

The Conflict_db and LTMS allow us to find consistent sets of
assumption assignments in a finite-domain constraint system.  This
allows us to create many applications such as software for basic
diagnosis. In order to make writing applications involving time
easier, we specialize the conflict database to a database with simple
temporal capabilities.  In the Conflict_db, there is a single
collection of variables and clauses with no particular structure.
Conceptually in the temporal specialization, we have sets of variables
and clauses representing discrete time steps.  Time is represented as
a sequence of positive integers. Each variable belongs to a single
time step.  Clauses are divided into those clauses that constrain
variables within the same time step, referred to as state constraints,
and those that constrain variables within the current and next time
step, referred to as transitions.  Transitions represent constraints
such as, "if the valve is open now, it receives the command to close,
and no failures happen, it will be closed in the next time step".
<p>
Given the variables from a single time step t0 and the state
constraints, we could set the variables that represent observations
and employ the same search procedure used on the Conflict_db to find a
consistent set of assignments to the assumptions found in time step
t0.  We may also request that the temporal database create a new time
step.  Conceptually, the temporal database creates a new copy of the
variables to represent the system at time step t1 and creates a new
copy of the state constraints that constrain these variables.  It also
creates a copy of the transition constraints to place constraints
between some of the variables in t0 and some of the variables in t1.
We may again set the observation variables in t0 and t1 and employ our
search procedures to find a consistent assignment to all of the
assumptions found in the variables of t0 and t1.  Rather than a
diagnosis at a single time step, these assumptions will represent the
evolution of the system over several time steps. 
<p>
Note that the search procedure has no knowledge that the variables
represent different points in time, or that some constraints go across
time and some apply within a time step.  It simply finds a consistent
assignment for the entire constraint system.  Similarly to perform a
consistency check, a consistency checker such as the LTMS need not
know that some propositions represent variable assignments at
different time points than other propositions.
<p>
Of course, we cannot simply keep adding variables and constraints for
an indefinite number of time steps.  At some point we will reach a
memory limit for storing the theory, or a computation limit for
searching over the growing theory.  Our temporal database must
therefore provide a way of cutting off parts of the theory as we
continue to add new time steps.  We achieve this by summarizing all of
the variables in the oldest time steps in the theory into a single
assumption and a small set of constraints.  <p>

Suppose we have 10 time steps and our search procedure has thus far
found two consistent assignments to the assumptions.  Suppose one
assignment causes the variable representing the valve flow to have
value "high" at time step t5. We'll indicate this by "5#flow=high".
Suppose the other assignment enforces "5#flow=low".  Each of these
values is constrained by the clauses and variable assignments in time
steps t0 through t4.  Suppose we introduce a new assumption variable
"History" with two values "h1" and "h2".  Suppose we now introduce the
constraints 
<ul>
<li> "History=h1 IMPLIES 5#flow=high" 
<li> "History=h2 IMPLIES 5#flow=low" 
</ul>
The assignments to History now have the same effect as the constraints
and two consistent assignments to the assumptions in time steps t0
through t4.  We may then throw out all constraints and variables in
those time steps.  What we lose is the ability to search for other
consistent assignments to the assumptions in time steps t0 through t4.
We summarize only those that are known when we perform the
summarization.

<h1>Implementation of Temporal Functionality</h1>

The T_system (for transition system) class subclasses the Conflict_db
class and and provides the needed temporal functionality.  At a high
level, the additional functionality the T_system provides is:
<ul>
<li> Create a copy of the variables and state clauses for a new time step
<li> Create the transitions that will provide constraints between the
     last time step and the new time step
<li> Truncate off the oldest time steps
</ul>
<p>
MORE HERE
<p>
In order to enable the T_system to create copies of a single time
step, it creates variables and state clauses slightly differently.  
Methods are provided such that when the first time step of the model
is created by the user, all the initial variables and clauses are
recorded as being a model of a single time step.  When a new time step
is created, the T_system creates a copy of these variables and
clauses to represent the new time step.

<h3>Development note: Where strings are currently used internally</h3>

In order to introduce at each time step only those transitions that
might be enable by the command that was given, the T_system keeps a
mapping from command assignments to the set of transition clauses that
are enabled by that command assignment.  When a command variable's
value is assigned, the T_system looks up the assignment, reads out the
transition clauses it appears in, and inserts those into the theory.

Currently, the command to transition mapping that the T_system stores
is stored in terms of the string representation.  That is, it includes
the string "cmd=value", rather than the assignment object or
proposition that represents the command assignment.  It also
represents the clause to be introduced in the string form,
for example (roughly speaking) as the string <p>
"valveCmd=closed AND valve=open AND valveTransition=nominal IMPLIES next(valve)=closed"
<p>
This string represents a <i>proto-transition</i> clause.  That is, 
this string can be used to instantiate the valve transition clauses
between any two time steps where valveCmd=closed.  If we instantiate
this proto-transition between time steps t3 and t4, the following
transition clause results (roughly speaking):
<p>
3#valveCmd=closed AND 3#valve=open AND 3#valveTransition=nominal IMPLIES 4#valve=closed
<p>
Strings are currently used because they provided a very easy way to
find the appropriate propositions to constrain.  That is, if the
proto-transition contains "valveCmd=closed" and we wish to instantiate
it at time step 3, we can form the string "3#valveCmd=closed" and
query the LTMS to find the proposition with that name.  This was easy
to implement but is slow.  There is a faster technique that is not yet
implemented.   The details follow but are probably not worthwhile for
anyone not involved in development.
<p>
Develoment detail: A faster technique would be to have the variables
at the front of the model (the unchanging "current" time step) where
the transition clauses are being added record a pointer to the
variable that represents the same quantity in the previous time step.
When we move time forward, the current variables update their pointers
to the variables in the next to current time step.  Then we can store
the transitions in terms of the current variables.  When we need to
find that same variable one step in the past, we may simply follow its
pointer to its predecessor.

<h2>Additional methods of the LTMS class to support T_system</h2>

For detail, see <a href="tms/class_ltms.html">LTMS documentation</a>
<ul>
<li><b>
void move_support(Proposition* prop, Slist<Clause*> clauses,
Proposition* new_prop); </b><br>

<p><li><b>
void add_summary_clause(Theory::time_step_t index, Proposition &new_prop, bool move_support,
						Slist<Clause*> &new_clauses);
</b><br>
Inserts a new, deleted clause of the form new_prop -> P for each
proposition P that in time step index that is currently supported by a 
clause whose time step is less than index.  Conceptually the new clause
summarizes the chain of support for P.   Once all propositions of
interest have had their support before a given time step summarized,
the theory before the index can be removed with remove_theory.

<p><li><b>
void remove_theory(Theory::time_step_t start, Theory::time_step_t end);
</b><br>
Removes all propositions and clauses with indices between start and end
from the theory.  In addition, any clauses that include propositions from
the removed indices are removed as well.  This is useful for removing
clauses that have been summarized by add_summary_clause.
