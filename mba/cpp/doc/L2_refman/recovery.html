 <hr>
 <p>Recovery allows L2 to find an action sequence that will put the modeled
 system into a desired state.</p>

 <p>During diagnosis, L2 searches for the assmptions of mode failure
 transitionsthat will make the state of the system consistent with the
 observations that have been received and the command that were issued.</p>

 <p>During recovery, the user assigns the observations they would like to be
 true. L2 then searches for the commands that will make those observations
 true.</p>

 <h2>Enabling Recovery</h2>

 <p>A restricted form of recovery was implemented in Livingstone 2 starting
 with version 2.4. Versions 2.4 to 2.7.1 required the L2 library (and hence the
 executables) to be compiled either for diagnosis or for recovery.
 <ul>
   <li>On Unix, configure with the <code>--enable-recovery option.</code></li>
   <li>On Windows, ensure the macro <code>ENABLE_RECOVERY</code> is defined in
       the project files for readers, debuggers and transition.</li>
 </ul></p>

 <p>Starting with version 2.7.2, Livingstone does not have to be re-compiled.
 A run-time flag specifies whether a Livingstone instance is being used for
 diagnosis or recovery. To set this flag, call
 <code>LTMS::set_planning()</code> as the first operation. The
 <a href="#LowLevelCLI">low-level command-line interface</a>, described below,
 allows this to be accomplished with a command-line option. The
 <a href="#HighLevelAPI">high-level API</a>, described below, takes care of
 this automatically.</p>

 <h2>Interfaces</h2>

 <a name="LowLevelCLI"></a>
 <h4>Low-Level Command-Line Interface</h4>

 <p>An instance of Livingstone can run either in diagnosis mode or in recovery
 mode. An instance of Livingstone starts in diagnosis mode. If recovery mode is
 enabled, it must be done before any observation/assign or command/progress,
 using <code>LTMS::set_planning()</code>. Pass the command-line option "-r" or
 "-recovery" to <code>l2test</code> to put Livingstone into recovery mode.</p>

 <p>Set the initial state of your system in the .ini file and load the model.
 Use the command
 <pre>
  plan-steps {n}
 </pre>
 to set the maximium number of time steps your plan will require. This will set
 up a model structure very similar to that used during diagnosis.</p>

 <p>If your plan will require two actions that may be performed at the same
 time (for example, opening two valves), it requires 1 time step. If it
 requires two actions in sequence (for example power cycling a device by
 turning it off then on) it requires two time steps.</p>

 <p>Now, set the observations that you require in the final state of your plan
 using
 <pre>
  assign {variable}={value}
 </pre></p>

 <p>Finally, call <code>find-candidates</code>. Each Candidate is a recovery
 plan. That is, each of its Assignments is to a Command at a specific time
 step. If there are no Candidates, no plan could be found. Consider increasing
 the number of plan steps allowed.</p>

 <a name="HighLevelAPI"></a>
 <h4>High-Level API</h4>

 <p>This interface supplies an operation that creates a new temporary instance
 of the the Livingstone engine, puts it in recovery mode, passes it a planning 
 problem, and packages up the result. Because this approach makes a copy of
 the Livingstone engine, it could be termed a "clone" implmentation.</p>

 <p>The API is a single method, Livingstone::reconfigure().Method
 <code>Livingstone::reconfigure()</code> allows a program to describe
 a recovery/reconfiguration problem as the maximum number of plan steps, the
 initial mode assignments and the goal observations; the result is returned
 as a set of commands to perform at each time step.</p>

 <p>To set up a planning problem, you have to specify values for the first
 four parameters. The plan is returned in the fifth parameter. The boolean
 return value specifies whether a plan was found. The parameters are as
 follows:
 <dl>
   <dt>L2_file* l2_file</dt>
   <dd>This is the object into which Livingstone has read the model file. To
       avoid having to read in the model again, this object is passed to the
       planning clone. The pointer can be retrieved with the accessor 
       <code>Livingstone_reader::get_file()</code>; since both 
       <code>Livingstone</code> and <code>Livingstone_debug</code> are
       subclasses of <code>Livingstone_reader</code>, this method can be
       called on your Livingstone object.</dd>

   <dt>unsigned planSteps</dt>
   <dd>This is the maximum length of the plan in plan steps. Actions for the
       same time step may be perfomed in any order. If it is too small, no
       plan will be found. If it is too large, the plan may be longer than
       necessary.</dd>

   <dt>Array&lt; pair&lt;unsigned, unsigned&gt; &gt;& initialModes</dt>
   <dd>Each element is a <code>pair</code> object, the first element of which
       is the Variable ID of a mode Variable and the second element of which
       is the index of a value in its domain.</dd>

   <dt>Array&lt; pair&lt;unsigned, unsigned&gt; &gt;& goalObservations</dt>
   <dd>Each element is a <code>pair</code> object, the first element of which
       is the Variable ID of an Observable Variable and the second element of
       which is the index of a value in its domain.</dd>

   <dt>Array&lt;Action *&gt;& plan</dt>
   <dd>Each element is a pointer to an object of class Livingstone::Action. Use
       the accessors 
       <ul>
         <li><code>unsigned getVariableID()</code></li>
         <li><code>unsigned getValueIndex()</code></li>
         <li><code>unsigned getPlanStep()</code></li>
       </ul>
       The caller is responsible for deleting these action objects.</dd>

 </dl></p>
 
 <h3>High-Level Command-Line Interface</h3>

 <p>A higher-level command-line interface is being designed. It will supply
 commands to 
 <ul>
   <li>set the start state (a set of mode assignments),
   <li>set the goal state (a set of observation assignments)
   <li>set the maximum length of the plan
   <li>create the plan and
   <li>access the plan's actions.
 </ul></p>

 <h2>A recovery example</h2>

<h3>Using the Low-Level Command-Line Interface</h3>

<p>Below is a recovery example using the circuit breaker model from
<code>mba/cpp/tests/cb</code>.</p>

<p>We set the plan steps to 1. This is because all circuit breakers may be
turned on and off in parallel.</p>

<p>We then assign the output of led8 to on.   In order to achieve this, we
must turn on the 4 circuit breakers between led8 and the power source.  The
first fc returns this answer.</p>

<p>Next, we also assign the output of led1 to on.  In order to achieve led8
and led1 on, our recovery must be augmented to turn on additional circuit
breakers.</p>


<pre>
       L2> plan-steps 1
       L2> assign cbAndLed.led8.ledState=on
       L2> fc
       Step 2; 197 variables; 0 conflicts before; 12 after.
       CBFS: exhaustive search, returned fewer than 5 candidate(s)
       The 1 candidates are:
         Candidate 0)
              1#cbAndLed.cb8.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb12.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb14.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb15.cmdIn=on :1

      L2> assign cbAndLed.led1.ledState=on
      L2> fc
      Step 2; 197 variables; 12 conflicts before; 21 after.
      CBFS: exhaustive search, returned fewer than 5 candidate(s)

      The 1 candidates are:
      Candidate 0)
              1#cbAndLed.cb8.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb12.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb14.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb15.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb1.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb9.cmdIn=on :1
              1#cbAndLed.cb13.cmdIn=on :1

 <h3>Using the High-Level API</h3>

 <p>The following is a complete program for exercising the high-level API. If
 you want to copy this code, take care of the '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters,
 which had to be escaped for HTML.</p>

 <p>This example assumes a particular model, with a particular integer mapping
 for the model Variables and their values. You can get this mapping for any
 model from the utility <code>mba/cpp/bin/api_gen</code>.</p>
