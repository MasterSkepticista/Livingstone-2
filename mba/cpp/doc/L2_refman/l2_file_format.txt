Description of the L2 file format
=================================
$Id: l2_file_format.txt,v 1.2 2001/03/14 04:37:56 bhudson Exp $

Generalities:
-------------
The encoding is ascii; we do not use binary data.

All numbers are in base 10.  Later, we may use a different base to save
space (base 36 perhaps -- digits plus letters).

IDs are 0-based.


Overall format:
---------------
The file has several sections.

The file is identified by a magic cookie: L211 (for L2 file format, version
1.1 of the format)

Afterwords, we have sections; these are identified as a single word on a
line.  The allowable sections are (full name on left, abbrev. on right):
        enums           e
        variables       v
        propositions    p
        clauses         cl
        transitions     t
        background      b
        observed        o
        commands        cm
        modes           m
        initial         i

Debugging information can be found in:
        variables
        enums
        transitions
The section name will be prefixed by 'dbg_' if debugging information is
available.


enums Section
-------------
Length:  1 + number of enumeration types.
Prereqs: none
Format:
    First line: count
    Lines 1 through n:
        the number of members of enum i
    For commands, the member which corresponds to no command being issued
    is the member 0.  Otherwise, the order is unconstrained.
Debugging information:
        suffix the name of the enumeration, then the name of each member
Sample line:
        2
Sample with debug info:
        2 boolean true false

variables section
-----------------
Length:  1 + number of variables
Prereqs: enums
Format:
    First line: count
    Lines 1 through n:
        the type (enumID) of variable i
Debugging information:
        the fully-qualified name of variable i
Sample line:
        1
Sample with debug info:
        1 mode

propositions section
--------------------
Length:  1 + number of props
Prereqs: variables, enums
Format:
        Line 1:    pos neg eq ne
        (counts of positive / negative propositions, then
         of positive/negative equalities)
        for positive or negative propositions (first pos+neg lines after
        the counts):
                varID valueID
        valueID is a member of the type of varID
        for equalities/inequalities (last eq+ne lines):
                varID varID
        the types of the two must match.
No debug info.
Sample line:
        3 1

clauses section
---------------
Length:  1 + number of clauses
Prereqs: propositions
Format:
        First line: count
        Lines 1 through n:
                propID [propID [...]]
        represents the conjunction of the propositions
Debugging information:
        prefix the name of the component
Sample lines:
        1
        1 2 54 95
Sample with debug info:
        test.cb 1 2 54 95


observed, commands, modes sections:
-----------------------------------
Length:  1 line
Prereqs: variables
Format:
        varID [varID ...]

        We add the attribute (observed, commanded, or mode) to
        listed variables.
No debug info.
Sample line:
        1 4 7 8

transitions section
-----------------------------
Length:  1 + number of transitions
Prereqs: clauses, variables, enums
Format:
        First line: count of nominal transitions
        Secont line: count of failure transitions
        Lines 1 through n:
                varID memberID memberID clauseID [clauseID ...]
                   ^      ^        ^       ^
               mode-var  from      to    prereqs
        Lines n+1 through n+f:
                varID memberID memberID rank clauseID [clauseID ...]
                   ^      ^        ^            ^
               mode-var  from      to         prereqs
        'rank' is the probability of the failure transition.
        'prereqs' is a disjunction of clauses
Debugging information:
        prefix the transition name
Sample line:
        (nominal)
        1 1 2 1
        (failure)
        1 0 1 1 2
Sample line with debug info:
        (nominal)
        recover 1 1 2 1
        (failure)
        fault 1 0 1 1 2


background section
------------------
Length:  1 + number of clauses in the background model
Prereqs: clauses
Format: count
        Lines 1 to n:  clauseID
Debugging information: none
Sample line:
        1

initial section
---------------
Length: 1 + number of initializations
Prereqs: variables, enums
Format:  count
         Lines 1 to n: varID memberID
Debugging information: none
Sample line:
        48 1
