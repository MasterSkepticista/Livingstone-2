<h1>Inclusion of Truncated Failures</h1>


This change only applies when using min-progress and truncation.
<p>
Overview<br>
---------<br>
When using min-progress, a component mode can enter a failure 
just after the history horizon.   Thus, if a component failed 
some time in the history that was truncated, we can represent that failure as occuring
at the history horizon.
<p>
Benefit<br>
---------<br>
This will eliminate most situations where the system cannot 
find a diagnosis because the time when the component failed 
was truncated before the diagnosis was made.  It will also eliminate situations where
the system comes up with a highly unlikely diagnosis on a second component because the
failure of the first component was truncated off before it was diagnosed.
<p>

Detail<br>
---------<br>
<pre>
When using min progress, we do not represent every component
mode at every time step.  We only represent a mode when it
is commanded.  When it is commanded, we put in constraints
that represent the different failure possibilities.

When we truncate off the history at time t, we create a 
startState variable.  If component C's mode had value m at
time t, in the past we would insert a constraint of the form:

 StartState=s0  --->  t#C.mode=m

This constraint does not include the possibility of failure.  
Thus if we do not command C again, there will be no way to
create a diagnosis where C has failed.

We address this by modifying truncation.   When we truncate the
history of C, if no opportunities for C to fail are represented
in the model, we introduce the following constraints:


 StartState=s0 & (t-1)#C.modeTransition=nominal ---> #C.mode=m
 (t-1)#C.modeTransition=failure1  --->  t#C.mode=failure1
 (t-1)#C.modeTransition=failure2  --->  t#C.mode=failure2

Thus, any potential faliures of C in the part of its history
that was truncated are represented by a failure at the first
time step after the horizon.

This gives the system back the ability to involve C in failures
even if it has not been commanded recently.
