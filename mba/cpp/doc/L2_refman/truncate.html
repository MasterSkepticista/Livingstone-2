<h1 align="center">The L2 Truncation Algorithm</h1>

This document describes the workings of the truncation algorithm.<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

The truncation algorithm needs to:
<ol>
<li> Reduce the number of variables, to limit memory and CPU usage.
<li> Correctly summarize previous timesteps.
<li> (would-be-nice item) For debugging, continue to encode what happened
     in the past.  Namely, a candidate should keep track of old failures.
</ol>

The input is a time horizon, before which all trajectories are truncated.
The output is the new Tracker, with fewer variables than before.

<h2>Data structures</h2>

The algorithm mainly runs over the list of variables that the conflict
database keeps.<p>

The assumption is that the list is always prepended to as new variables are
created.  Therefore, the variables are ordered by time: time <i>t</i>
first, then on down to the horizon, and NOW last.  In the code, check for
the words "Assumes sorted by time:" which we've copied everywhere.<p>

This assumption affects decisions like:
<ul>
<li> Creating new variables to encode the summary
<li> Optimizing by not creating new variables if they wouldn't really
        change the diagnosis (the AAAI paper optimization).
<li> Anything else that might affect the order of variables in the list.
</ul>

We could fix this by keeping a PQ of variables, sorted by time.<p>

Another data structure is the list of candidates.  The Tracker stores it;
there's nothing much to be said about it.<p>

Each candidate stores a list of Assignments.  They are important in that
they store pointers to the variables.<p>

To encode the summary, we use a new variable 'state', and for each
candidate we're truncating, a value for the variable.  Candidate i is
summarized by the proposition 'state=s_i'.  The summary is constructed by
creating a set of clause of the form (state=s_i) implies var=value for each
var on the horizon. <p>

It's important to note that we only summarize the value of the mode
variables, since no other variables are directly constrained by a variable
in a previous timestep.



<h2>Algorithms</h2>

Upon a call to <code>Tracker::truncate(unsigned)</code>, we run:

<pre>
truncate(h)                     -- in class Tracker
    deassert observations
    create start-state variable 'state'
    foreach candidate i,
        install(i)
        summarize(i, h)
        truncate-candidate(i, h)
    remove-old-variables(h)
    add-new-info
    reassert observations
    install(0)
</pre>
We need to deassert observations because otherwise, if there's a conflict
between predicted and observed, summarize-variables may no be able to correctly
resolve the modes.  The implementation takes care only to deassert if there
actually is a conflict; that doesn't affect the analysis here.

<pre>
summarize(i, h)                 -- in class T_system
    summarize-variables(i,h)
    summarize-conflicts(i,h)
</pre>

We create the clause, but just store it until <code>add-new-clauses</code>.
This is mainly for speed: so the TMS doesn't try to propagate through those
clauses.  There's also a correctness issue which is an implementation
detail.  Note that <i>h#mode</i> refers to the variable at timestep
<i>h</i> or, if there is none at that timestep (as in min-progress), the
first after <i>h</i>.  The <i>transition</i> variable is included to allow
diagnosing a failure that happened before the horizon.
<pre>
summarize-variables(i, h)       -- in class T_system
    foreach mode
        (call Transitioned::set_initial_mode, which is:)
        add the constraint:
             state=s_i /\ transition=nominal  ==&gt; h#mode=value[h#mode]
        unless (h-1)#mode is unconstrained
</pre>


Similarly, we create the conflict but don't add it, which shouldn't matter
except that as of this writing (2000-12-18) we iterate over all conflicts.
This function replaces old conflicts which are current in this candidate
with new conflicts that conflict <code>state=s_i</code> with the
assignments that remain.  One thing to note is that, by definition, the
candidate does not conflict with itself; therefore, if we end up with no
assignments in the conflict but the assignment for the candidate, we've lost
all the information to detect the conflict, so we should simply ignore it.
<pre>
summarize-conflicts(i, h)       -- in class T_system
    foreach conflict with an assignment at time &lt; h that is current
        set A = {0}
        foreach assignment a
            if it's state=s_i
                ignore it
            if a is at time &lt; h
                ignore it
            otherwise
                A = A u {a}
        if A is empty, skip   (conflict is completely truncated)
        A = A u { state=s_i }
        create new conflict using A
</pre>


<code>truncate-candidate</code> replaces assignments in the candidate that
are older than time <i>h</i> by the assignment <code>state=s_i</code>.
This is similar to <code>summarize-conflicts</code>, except that we just
change the candidates rather than create new ones.
<pre>
truncate-candidate(i, h)        -- in class Candidate
    weight = 0
    foreach assignment
        if it's state=s_i
            ignore it
        if assignment is at time &lt; h
            weight += w[assignment]
            remove it
    add the assignment state=s_i
    set its weight to weight
</pre>


Note: the first loop, over the conflicts, should probably be handled by the
Conflict_db in destroy-variable.
<pre>
remove-old-variables(h)         -- in class T_system
    foreach conflict at time &lt; h
        remove from list
        deallocate
    destroy variables at time &lt; h
    foreach mode variable nearest the horizon
        if the closest is the NOW variable,
            remove the state=s_i clauses from it
    tms.finish-destroying()
</pre>

Implementation detail: we pass in a function <code>f(var)</code> which returns
true if var is at time &lt; h, which is how we know what to remove from the
assignable and assumption lists; we also pass in iterators that mark the start
and end of the <i>t0</i> variables at time &lt; h, which is how we know to
iterate over only those in the third loop.
<pre>
destroy-variables               -- in class Conflict_db
    foreach assignable,
        if at time &lt; h, remove from the list
    foreach assumption,
        if at time &lt; h, remove from the list
    foreach variable at time &lt; h
        remove from the list
        var.leaveTMS()
        deallocate the variable ;
            if assignable, that deallocates the assignments
</pre>

<pre>
finish-destroying               -- in class LTMS
    remove marked clauses from fringe, volatile_fringe, unsatisfied
    list-to-unassign &lt;- {}
    foreach marked clause
        if it supports an unmarked prop
            add prop to list-to-unassign
    ptheory.finish-destroying
    foreach prop on list-to-unassign
        unassign prop
</pre>

<pre>
finish-destroying               -- in class Ptheory
    foreach clause
        if marked
            remove from clauses list
            foreach prop in it
                if not marked
                    remove clause from prop's list
            deallocate clause
    foreach prop
        if marked
            remove from props list
            deallocate prop
</pre>

<pre>
var.leaveTMS                    -- in class Variable
    foreach prop of var
        mark-prop
</pre>

<pre>
mark-prop                       -- in class Proposition
    foreach clause of prop
        mark clause for destruction
    mark prop for destruction
</pre>

<pre>
add-new-info                    -- in class T_system
    add clauses created by summarize-variables
    add conflicts created by summarize-conflicts
</pre>



<h2>Time complexity analysis</h2>

Definitions: <i>n</i> number of variables per time step.  <i>k</i> is the
number of values each variable has (which actually varies per variable but
we'll assume for simplicity is the max over all of them).  I further assume
there are <i>O(k)</i> non-mutex clauses per variable.  <i>t</i> is the number
of timesteps; <i>t0</i> just those timesteps earlier than the horizon
<i>h</i>.  <i>d</i> is the number of canDidates, <i>f</i> the number of
conFlicts, <i>F</i> the size of each conflict.  <i>T(func)</i> is the time
spent doing <i>func</i>.<p>

Possibly-unwarranted assumptions: <i>f*F</i> is much smaller than <i>n</i>.
Each variable has <i>O(k^2)</i> clauses, including the <i>k^2/2</i> mutex
clauses.<p>

Certainly-unwarranted assumption: install is constant-time.  It's likely
closer to linear in the number of clauses.<p>

<b>mark-prop</b>: <i>O(k)</i> since there are that many mutex clauses.<p>

<b>var.leaveTMS</b>: <i>O(k^2)</i>: there are <i>k</i> propositions.<p>

<b>Ptheory.finish-destroying</b>: <i>O(tnk^3)</i> since there are
<i>O(tnk^2)</i> clauses, and each has up to <i>O(k)</i> propositions.  It would
be nice to get a tighter bound.  Removing from the lists is constant-time since
we are iterating over the entire list: we just remove those iterators that need
to be destroyed.<p>

<b>LTMS.finish-destroying</b>: <i>O(tnk^3)</i> from calling the ptheory
version.  We add <i>O(t0*n*k^2)</i> from removing from the fringe (if -- highly
unlikely -- all clauses were on the fringe; note, <i>t0</i> since we remove
only things we delete), and <i>O(tnk)</i> from unassigning the propositions (if
every one is unassigned, which is rather more likely; note, <i>t</i> since we
unassign things we don't delete).<p>

<b>destroy-variables</b>: <i>O(t*n+t0*n*k^2)</i>.  <i>O(k^2)</i> from
<code>leaveTMS</code> which we call <i>t0*n</i> times (once per variable).
In the implementation, we pass iterators such that we only iterate over the
subset of the main list that predates the horizon.  However, we do iterate over
every assignable and assumption.  Given about half of the variables are
assignable, this means we iterate over <i>O(t*n)</i> variables to remove from
those lists.<p>

<b>remove-old-variables</b>: <i>O(f+t0nk^2+tnk^3))</i>.
The foreach conflict loop takes <i>O(f)</i> time.
The call to destroy-variables takes <i>O(t*n)</i> time to set up (to get the
iterators; this could be made faster), then <i>T(destroy-variable) =
O(t*n+t0*n*k^2)</i> time; cleaning up the modes takes <i>O(n*k)</i> time
since there are <i>n</i> modes, and I assume fewer than <i>k</i> transition
clauses (true?).  The bulk of the time is thus spent in finish-destroying.<p>

<b>truncate-candidate</b>: <i>O(1)</i>.  Linear in the number of
assignments for the candidate.  I've seen at most 4 since we only store
failures and the start state in a candidate, so call it O(1).<p>

<b>summarize-conflicts</b>: <i>O(fF)</i> as we do <i>O(F)</i> work for each
conflict, and there are <i>f</i> conflicts.<p>

<b>summarize-variables</b>: <i>O(tn)</i>.  Creating a clause takes constant
time; we have <i>O(n)</i> horizon variables.  Finding the variable at the
horizon requires hopping back at most <i>t</i> variables.<p>

<b>summarize</b>: <i>O(fF+tn)</i> since we just call the two summarize
calls.<p>

<b>deassert-observations</b> and <b>reassert-observations</b> take O(n) time
since there are O(n) observed variables, and it's constant time to assert or
deassert the clauses.  It involves more propagating, though, in the install.
<p>

<b>truncate</b>: <i>O( d*(fF+tn) + (t*n*k^3))</i>.  This is based on
<i>d*T(install)*T(summarize)*T(truncate-candidate) + 
T(remove-old-variables) + T(install) + T([dr]eassert-observations)</i>, with
the wrong assumption that <code>install</code> is constant-time.  It's not, and
is actually rather expensive (something like linear in the theory size).  But
the dominant term here, <i>O(t*n*k^3)</i>, does not depend on the speed of
installs.
<p>

<h2>Further work</h2>

The <code>T_system</code> could store iterators into the list of variables
to keep track of where the start of the horizon and the start of the timed
variables are.  This would speed up remove-old-variables by a
constant factor.<p>

If <code>install</code> turns out to be the bottleneck, we could spend some
time before <code>remove-old-variables</code> to find commonalities between
candidates, and assert those clauses regardless of which candidate is in.
Installing a candidate would add only what's new to that candidate.<p>

For min-progress, we only introduce a constant number of new variables per
timestep.  It would be nice to only move a constant number of clauses --
likely most of the time spent in min-progress is spent truncating.<p>

The analysis needs some work:
<ul>
<li> Prove Ptheory.finish-destroying takes more like <i>O(tnk^2)</i>
<li> Figure out what f and F really are.  If necessary, get smarter about
     summarize-conflicts.
</ul>
