<title>L2 initialization</title>

This document decribes the procedure for creating the livingstone engine
and initializing it, using the string API.  The procedure is
straight-forward although it has a number of steps.

<h2>Data structures</h2>

You will use need the following classes:
<ul>
<li><code>L2_string_map</code>: a mapping from strings to the internal
        objects and vice-versa.
<li><code>L2_string_map_listener</code>: keeps the mapping up to date.
<li><code>L2_file</code>: an in-memory representation of the model file.
<li><code>Tracker</code>: the engine itself.
<li><code>Tracker_debug</code>: a string-based debugger for the engine.
<li><code>from_l2</code> or <code>from_xmpl</code>: reads the model from a
        file in l2 or xmpl format into the <code>L2_file</code> in-memory
        representation.
<li><code>to_t_system</code>: reads the <code>L2_file</code>
        representation and translates to the representation used by the
        <code>T_system</code> (which is contained by the
        <code>Tracker</code>)
</ul>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

The <code>L2_string_map</code> and <code>L2_file</code> can be created at
any time; they don't need anything to be created.<p>

The <code>Tracker</code> can be created as soon as you have the arguments
to its constructor, and as soon as you know what kind of tracker you
want (CBFS or Cover).<p>

The <code>Tracker_debug</code> needs to know about both the
<code>Tracker</code> and the <code>L2_string_map</code>, and therefore must
be constructed after those two.  For now, the debugger must be created
before loading the model; this will change.<p>

For instance:
<pre>
struct My_L2_engine {
        L2_string_map map;
        L2_file file;
        Tracker *tracker;
        Tracker_debug *debugger;
        L2_string_map_listener *listener;
};
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        // parse the arguments
        My_L2_engine l2;        // creates map and file
        l2.tracker = new CBFS_tracker(1,2,3,4);
        l2.debugger = new CBFS_tracker_debug(*l2.tracker, l2.map, cout);

        // more later
}
</pre>

<h2>Reading a model</h2>

First, decide whether you're reading an XMPL-format model (for instance,
the set of files cb.xmpl, cb.hrn, and cb.ini) or an L2-format model (a
single file cb.l2).  In the former case, use the <code>from_xmpl</code>
class; in the latter, use <code>from_l2</code>.<p>

Also create a <code>to_t_system</code>.  Both it and the
<code>from_*</code> object can be on the stack; we don't need them having
loaded the file.<p>

Finally, we have all the information to create the listener which will
keep the string to internals mapping up to date, so create it as well.<p>

Only now can we actually read the file; use <code>from_l2::read</code> to
read it into memory, and <code>to_t_system::write</code> to put it into the
engine.  You _must_ have set the listener by now, otherwise it won't know
about the data created by these operations.<p>

Setting the initial state is something I'd like to see change; but for now,
the model file includes it.  Register it with the engine by calling
<code>to_t_system::createInitialState</code>.<p>


<pre>
        // continued from above

        {
            // in their own scope so we get rid of them as soon as we can
            from_xmpl from(l2.file);
            to_t_system to(l2.file);

            // must be here, not later!
            l2.listener = new L2_string_map_listener(l2.map, l2.file, to,
                *l2.tracker);

            // actually read
            from.read("cb");
            // now tell the engine about it
            to.write(l2.engine->get_t_system());
            to.createInitialState(l2.engine->get_t_system());
        }
</pre>

The <code>read</code> function returns a boolean, true if read succeeded,
false otherwise, so you can do some error checking.  The <code>write</code>
function also returns a boolean, but it never fails (though it might throw
an exception if something is very wrong).



<h2>Deallocating</h2>

Deallocate roughly in the reverse order that you allocated.  The exception
is that the <code>from_xmpl</code> or <code>from_l2</code> and the
<code>to_t_system</code> can be deallocated immediately after reading the
file.

<ol>
<li><code>L2_string_map_listener</code>
<li><code>Tracker_debug</code>
<li><code>Tracker</code>
<li><code>L2_file</code> and <code>L2_string_map</code>
</ol>

For instance, add the following to the struct definition from above:

<pre>
        My_L2_engine() {
            // make it safe to deallocate if we have an error half-way
            debugger = 0;
            tracker  = 0;
            listener = 0;
        }
        ~My_L2_engine() {
            delete listener;
            delete debugger;
            delete tracker;
            // the other two are implicitely deallocated
        }
</pre>
