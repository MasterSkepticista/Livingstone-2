<title>Full Progress, Minimal Progress and Optimization</title
</head>

<body>
<h1>Full-progress, min-progress and optimization</h1>

The progress commands (min-progress and full-progress) introduce
a new time step to the model and insert the constraints necessary
to model the evolution of the modeled hardware from the previous
time step to the new present time step.
<p>
Full-progress copies the entire model of the hardware system
at each time step.  
<p>
Min-progress copies only the minimal information needed to
model the old evolution of the hardware system:  the command
that was received at each time point, and the mode of the
component that was commanded at each time point.  This can
reduce the number of variables needed to represent the
evolution of the system by a factor in the 100s.
<p>
We describe full-progress first, as that is simpler.

<h3>Full progress algorithm </h3>

  This is documented in T_system->full_progress()

<pre>
full_progress(cmd=cmd_value)

  1. Copy all current variables into the new time step, representing the past

      - copy all dependent variables into new time step

      - copy all assignable variables into new time step
        - maintain a pair of current assignable,previous assignable used in 3.

      -  transition all transitioned variables TV into new time step 
         - create a new variable in the past time step.  Record it in TV.previous
         - instantiate all transition constraints
              - for each assignment   current_var=value_index   in the prototype
              - find the corresponding variable in the new time step (currently by name)
               - assign the corresponding variable to the value index

  2.  instantiate all state constraint prototypes

      - for each assignment   current_var=value_index   in the prototype
        - find the corresponding variable in the new time step (currently by name)
        - assign the corresponding variable to the value index

 3.   assign the assignable variables
      for each current assignable variable
        - find the corresponding past assignable in the new time step (currently by pair)
        - assign the past assignable to the same value as the current assignable,
          except for cmd, which is assigned to cmd_value
</pre>

<h4>Notes </h4>
 <ul>
  <li> We assign the assignable variables after we have instantiated
     the constraints in order to keep the assigned/unassigned counts right.
</ul>


<h3>Minimal progress algorithm</h3>
Conceptually, min-progress works by determining what component modes
could change when a command is given, and only introducing those modes
into the model of the new time step.  For example in the circuit
breaker model, if at time step 10 we give the command "min-progress
cb1.cmdIn=turnOn", only the variables needed to model whether cb1
turned on or failed are introduced.

In order to introduce the correct variables as quickly
as possible, min-progress needs to know what commands
effect which component modes.  This can happen in two
ways:

<ul>

 <li> If every component transition includes a variable
   that is a command, min-progress will work on the
   model as written.   

<p>
For example, in the circuit breaker model, each circuit breaker has an
input that tells it to open or close.  That input is a command that is
directly set by the test scenario.

<p>
One can load the circuit breaker model and run either full-progress or
min-progress.
<p>

<li> If some component transitions include variables that are not
   commands, but are related to a command the model is preprocessed so
   that all transition constraints only refer to the value of
   transitioned variables.
<p>
   For example, in the X37 model, there are relay models.
   The relay has a power throw whose mode changes from
   open to close.  The input to the power throw is
   equal to an input of the relay.  The relay input is
   the command that is set by the scenario.
<p>
   In this case, min-progress cannot directly map
   from the command (at the relay) to the mode (in the
   power throw) that will change.  It could do this
   reasoning, but we want min-progress be as fast as possible.
   We therefore do the reasoning once with a model-optimizer.
<p>
   If one wants to run the X37 model with min-progress, one
   has to first run it through an optimizer or modify the
   model by hand (see below).
</ul>

<pre>
minimal_progress(cmd=cmd_value)  {

   For each transitioned variable
      - look up whether cmd_value enables any transition constraint prototypes
   
      - If any transition prototypes are enabled, instantiate them

         - If any transitioned variable the prototype mentions doesn't yet exist
           in the new time step, create it and store it in the current variable's
           previous field. 

         - Instantiate the transition constraint prototype in the past

	       - for each assignment   transitioned_var=value_index   in the prototype
	            - read off the past variable in transitioned_var.previous
	            - assign the past variable to the value index
}
</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
 <ul>
<li>
Determining whether a transitioned variable TV has been copied into
the past yet on the current time step should be done by
checking a bit in TV to see if TV.previous was set on this
progress or is left over from a previous one.

<li>
Checking whether a cmd assignment enables any transitions of a
transitioned variable is a linear search, but the length is only the
domain of the command variable (roughly 5)

 <li>
Currently the code collects the enabled transition prototypes and instantiates
them.  It would be more efficient to just instantiate the ones that are
enabled where we now test them for inclusion in the collection that will
be instantiated.
</ul>

<h3>The model optimizer</h3>

 The model optimizer adjusts a Livingstone model so that
 the mapping from what command is given to what modes variables
 are needed is clear.  It does not change the logic of the model,
 it simply rewrites it in a way that is logically equivalent.

 <h4>Simple optimization</h4>
 Consider the X37 model.   The input to the relay is the command
 set by test scenarios.  The input to the relay's power throw is
 equal to the input of the relay.  If the power throw input is
 "on", the power throw goes on.  So, our relay includes a
 statement of the form
 <pre>
   relay1.cmdIn=relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn;
 </pre>
 and the power throw has a transition that captures the
 idea that the powerThrow goes on when commanded on
 <pre>
  powerThrow:
   transition(off,on,relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn=on)
 </pre>
 Because relay1.cmdIn and relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn are equal,
 relay1.cmdIn=on and relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn=on are equivalent
 statements.   Thus we can substitute one for the other:
 <pre>
  powerThrow:
   transition(off,on,relay1.cmdIn=on)
 </pre>
 Since relay1.cmdIn is the command assigned by the scenario,
 min-progress now knows what command effects powerThrow.mode.
 The optimizer simply goes through the model and makes these
 types of substitutions. 
 <p>
 For this simple type of optimization, one can also simply
 make relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn a top level command instead
 of relay1.powerThrow.   This satisfies the requirement
 that every mode be directly controlled by a top level command.

 <h4>More complex optimizations</h4>
 Suppose our model was a bit more complicated, and the relay
 only sent the command through to the power throw if the relay
 was OK.
 <pre>
   case (mode) 
     OK:
      relay1.cmdIn=relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn;

  powerThrow:
   transition(off,on,relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn=on)
 </pre>

 This can be simplified into a single transition as follows:
 <pre>
  powerThrow:
   transition(off,on, relay1.mode=ok && relay1.powerThrow.cmdIn=on)
 </pre>
 Again this is logically equivalent, but makes is possible for
 min-progress to represent component transitions using only
 mode variables and command variables.

<h3>In summary</h3>

 An optimized model contains the same information as a
 non-optimized model, and can be run with full-progress
 or min-progress.  
<p>
 An unoptimized model can be run with min-progress if
 every mode transition that is not a failure 
 is controlled directly by a top-level command that is
 set by the scenario.   This can often be achieved by
 simply changing which variables are commands for the
 purposes of testing.
