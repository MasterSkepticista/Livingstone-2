    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>A Livingstone model requires the modeler to enumerate the "modes" of
    each component in the model. Not only nominal (that is, normal or intended)
    modes but also failure modes must be modeled. To model a mode involves
    modeling the way the component enters and exits that mode.</p>

    <p>It is possible -- in fact, probably inevitable -- for a model to be
    incomplete in that either it does not enumerate every possible failure
    mode, or it does not enumerate every possible transition into a modeled
    failure mode. Furthermore, it is possible that Livingstone not receive
    all Commands given to the device being modeled, so it loses track of the
    device's mode.</p>

    <p>If this is the case, Livingstone may be unable to add assumptions to
    make the model consistent. This leads to Livingstone being unable to find
    any Candidates.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>

    <p>Livingstone modelers have addressed this problem by adding to each
    multi-mode component a catch-all failure mode that, by convention, is
    called the "unknown" mode (though it doesn't have to be named that). 
    A device that has only one mode (perforce a nominal mode) does not need to
    have an unknown failure mode.</p>

    <p>For the catch-all "unknown" failure mode, there must be 
    <ul>
      <li>a clauseless transition into the catch-all "unknown" failure mode from
          any other mode, and</li>
      <li>a clauseless transition from the catch-all "unknown" failure mode to
          itself.</li>
    </ul>
    There must not be
    <ul>
      <li>any transitions out of the "unknown" failure mode, or</li>
      <li>any clauses that assert anything about the "unknown" failure mode.</li>
    </ul>
    Because the catch-all "unknown" failure mode is minimally constrained,
    Livingstone will infer that the device is in this "unknown" failure mode
    whenever its engine is unable to infer that it is in any other mode.</p>

    <h2>The Ambiguity of Unknown</h2>

    <p>Having a component mode named <b>unknown</b> conflicts with the allowable 
    Livingstone variable value of <b>unknown</b>.  This is because 
    the <b>unknown</b> value means that Livingstone could not determine 
    which multi-mode proposition was true.  To disambiguate this situation,
    the catch-all failure mode should be named something other than <b>unknown</b>, 
    say <b>unknownFault</b>.</p>


    <h2>An Example</h2>

    <p>As an example, consider a device named "Thingamajig". Its nominal and
    identified failure modes are "modeA", "modeB" and "modeC".</p>

    <h3>Add the Catch-All Unknown Failure Mode</h3>

    <p>To the enumerated nominal and failure modes, add the catch-all "unknown"
    failure mode, here arbitrarily named "unknownFault":
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ci:attributetype name="thingamajig.ModeType"
        members="modeA modeB modeC unknownFault"/&gt;
    </pre></code></p>

    <h3>Add the Transition into The Catch-All Unknown Failure Mode</h3>

    <p>There must be a transition into the catch-all "unknown" failure mode from
    any mode. To keep from inferring that this transition took place unless you
    have no alternative, keep the probability low. The keyword "unknownFailureRank" 
    signifies the lowest probability, exp(-10).
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ci:transition to="unknownFault" probability="unknownFailureRank" from="*" 
        name="intoTheUnknown"/&gt;
    </pre></code></p>

    <h3>Add the Transition to Remain in The Catch-All Unknown Failure Mode</h3>

    <p>There must be a transition from the catch-all "unknown" failure mode into
    itself. This Transition must have a Clause with an empty set of Terms.
    <code><pre>
    &lt;ci:transition to="unknownFault" from="unknownFault"&gt;
      &lt;ci:clause/&gt;
    &lt;/ci:transition&gt;
    </pre></code>

    <h3>The Model Elements that Are Not There</h3>

    <p>Make sure there is no other Transition in which the catch-all "unknown"
    failure mode participates, and there is no Clause that asserts anything
    about the catch-all "unknown" failure mode. Thus the name of the catch-all
    "unknown" failure mode (in this example, "unknownFault") must appear exactly 4
    times:
    <ul>
      <li>Once in the attribute type for the modes</li>
      <li>Once in the transition into the catch-all "unknown" failure mode</li>
      <li>Twice in the transition to remain in the catch-all "unknown" failure
          mode</li>
    </ul></p>

  <h2>Side Effects</h2>

  <p>Adding transitions to "unknown" failure modes will increase the number
  of Candidate diagnoses that the Tracker finds. At best this is clutter; at
  worst, when only a small number of Candidates are allowed, these "unknown"
  Candidates displace more meaningful ones. The best policy is to give
  transitions to "unknown" failure modes very low probabilities. This way, the
  more meaningful Candidates, if any, will be returned first. The symbol
  "unknownFailureRank" was designed for this purpose.</p>

  <h2>Software Support</h2>

  <p>Currently, nothing in Livingstone or Skunkworks requires that components
  with multiple modes include a catch-all "unknown" failure mode. The
  Livingstone XMPL reader or the JMPL compiler could be modified to check for
  the existence of such a mode and possibly to insert such a mode when it is
  found to be absent.</p>

  <p>In Stanley, beginning with release 2.7.1, when the user creates a new component, 
  a catch-all "unknown"
  failure mode is automatically added with a name of <b>unknownFault</b>.
  Stanley will not allow the user to name a new mode (ok or fault) <b>unknown</b>.
