    <b><code>doxygen</code></b></h1>

    <table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="10%">&nbsp;</td><td>

    <p>The Livingstone Reference Manual uses the <b><code>doxygen</code></b>
    document-generation system.</p>

    <p><b><code>doxygen</code></b> is like <b><code>Javadoc</code></b> in that
    it creates HTML documentation by extracting information from declarations,
    definitions and comments in source files. Unlike
    <b><code>Javadoc</code></b>, however, <b><code>doxygen</code></b> works
    with C, C++ and IDL source files and can produce several different document
    types. It also has many more features.</p>

    <p>Because the Reference Manual involves hundreds of files and can be
    reproduced (and customized) by anyone with the source code, these pages are
    not distributed with the Livingstone source code. An up-to-date version of
    these pages is served from the Skunkworks web site at
    <a href=
    "http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/mba/projects/L2/doc/L2_refman/index.html">
    http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/mba/projects/L2/doc/L2_refman/index.html
    </a>. This documentation is based on the <code>*.h</code> files only, and
    is not cross-indexed to source code.</p>

    <p>If you have the Livingstone source code and wish to install the
    Livingstone Reference Manual at your site, you can generate the HTML pages
    by extracting them yourself using <b><code>doxygen</code></b>. The present
    document aims to make this process a bit easier.</p>

    <h2>Installing <b><code>doxygen</code></b></h2>

    <p><b><code>doxygen</code></b> is open source; you can download and install
    it from the <b><code>doxygen</code></b> web site at
    <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">http://www.doxygen.org</a>. If you have
    additional tools in your environment, such as Qt and GraphViz, you can
    interact with <b><code>doxygen</code></b> via a GUI, produce documentation
    in formats other than HTML (e.g., LaTex, RTF or PDF) and generate more
    sophisticated graphics, but you can produce useful HTML pages with only
    the minimal required GNU tools (<code>flex</code>, <code>bison</code> and
    <code>make</code>).</p>

    <p>You can download a binary file for several operating systems. If it is
    available for your environment, save yourself a lot of trouble and do
    so.</p>

    <p>If you can not download a binary, you will have to build the binary from
    source. Download the tarball from the <code>doxygen</code> web site,
    extract the source, and run the <code>configure</code> script.</p>

    <p>You will almost certainly have to supply command-line options to
    <code>configure</code>. In particular,
    <ul>
      <li>if you are not root, you will have to supply as value for the
          <code>--prefix</code> option some directory into which the
          <code>doxygen</code> binary will be written; and</li>
      <li>you will probably have to specify the platform with the
          <code>--platform</code> option, selected from those listed in file
          PLATFORMS, which is part of the distribution.
    </ul></p>

    <p>Inclusion and collaboration graphs, which are included in the
    <a href=
    "http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/mba/projects/L2/doc/L2_refman/index.html">
    on-line Reference Manual</a>, require GraphViz, which you can download and
    install. Running <code>doxygen</code> from a GUI and producing documentation
    in other formats require additional software components.</p>
    
    <p>You might want to put the directory containing the executable into your
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

    <h2>Generating the Documentation</h2>

    <p>We have supplied a <b><code>doxygen</code></b> project file
    <code>mba/cpp/doc/L2_refman/Doxyfile</code>. The HTML pages it produces
    suit our purposes, but you might wish to customize this file to make the
    HTML better suited for your needs. The <code>doxygen</code> developers made
    sure that the project file is copiously self-documented, and you can get
    additional documenation about the configuration parameters at
    <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">the Doxygen web site</a>. After you are
    satisfied with the contents of this project file, you can create the
    documentation with the command:
<code><pre>
doxygen Doxyfile
</pre></code>
    If you are using <code>doxygen</code>'s GUI, you can use it to modify the
    project file and create the documentation.</p>

    <p>The supplied project file will place all the generated HTML, including
    the root frameset page <code>index.html</code>, in directory
    <code>mba/cpp/doc/L2_refman/html/</code>. Feel free to change this.
    However, please note that the "main page" of the documentation comes from a
    comment in file <code>mba/cpp/include/api/livingstone.h</code>. This main
    page contains HTML links to non-<b><code>doxygen</code></b>-generated web
    pages in directory <code>mba/cpp/doc/L2_refman/</code> and its siblings. If
    you do not wish to preserve the default directory structure, you should
    edit either this C++ header file or the generated HTML page(s) to fix or
    remove the broken links.</p>
