The files in this directory are used to build a manual for L2.

Modify the *.manual files ; the other files are generated from them.

If you change any of the files, make sure to update l2.manual to update
the DATE and VERSION.

That done, re-make the manuals which are stored in the CVS repository:
        make manuals
Only then should you check in.
