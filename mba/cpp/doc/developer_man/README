This is a manual that describes the design of the system.  truncate.html
and progress.html should be merged into here.


Diagrams are generated by xfig(1).  Use fig2dev to export to file.  The
makefile has rules to generate them all for the html documentation;
however, it doesn't have rules for info docs (which is probably fine) nor
for printed documentation (haven't tested any of this).

Since fig2dev is not a standard program, the png files are in CVS.
Make sure to add them to l2_update.



The manual files are texinfo files.  I run the perl script
./strip_leading_ws on them in order to remove whitespace that makes the
manual files readable as source; but make the info output unreadable.  The
output is placed in texi files.
