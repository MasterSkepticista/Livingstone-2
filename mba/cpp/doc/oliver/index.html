				  <h3>Why did you build this?</h3>
				  <p>
					Today most Livingstone models are hand coded or developed under Stanley.  Stanley is a well 
					refined and widely used application, however it does not support several critical features which could 
					not be added without making major changes to the architecture.  The most desirable of these features 
					is the importing of automatically generated models.  This feature was required to support the 
					Diagnostic Modeling Environment being developed by Northrop Grumman as part of the Space&nbsp;Launch&nbsp;Initiative(SLI) risk reduction program in IVHM.
					My work on a new editor was funded through this effort and by the Ames Skunkworks group.
				  </p>
					<h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
					Along with supporting the importing of generated models, the Editor has been designed with the following goals:
					<ul>
						<li>Simple and intuitive single frame user interface copied from standard IDEs such as Netbeans.</li>
						<li>Java based application stored in a single jar file.  Easily distributed and executed on any platform.</li>
						<li>Saves all modeling information in a single XML based file including all graphical, harness and initial state information.</li>
						<li>Implements all Stanley supported features.</li>
					</ul>		
				  </p>
					<h3>Does it work?</h3>
				  <p>
					You bet, but the application is at an early beta stage.  I have set up Gnats page to so users can submit bug/feature request, 
					and I will submit my own list of known bugs very soon.  I need beta testers, so if you think this might be a useful tool, 
					contact me and I'll will be glad to help you set things up, and even import existing modeling information.
