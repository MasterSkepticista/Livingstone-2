In addition to the automatic translation, I had to

1.  Change the cmd input 

    z_valve_module.z_cell_1.heater.preheat to
    z_valve_module.z_cell_1.heater.preheatCmd

    z_valve_module.z_cell_2.heater.preheat to
    z_valve_module.z_cell_2.heater.preheatCmd

  Why:  The code needs to know which vars are commands.  
        It should get this from the interface=cmd spec
        in the attribute, but right now it looks for
        cmd in the var name.  Yes, very lame.
