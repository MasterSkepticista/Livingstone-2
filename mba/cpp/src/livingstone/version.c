/* This file is partly auto-generated.
   If the version contains 'cvs', then the Unix build system will
   change this file to add a time to it.  If it doesn't, the file
   will be unchanged; the file will also be unchanged on Windows 
   and VxWorks.

   The format is:
        pre-version (cvs date)
   or
        version (released date)
   where 'version' is a number like 2.0 ; and 'date' is date +%Y-%m-%d
   when released, add %H:%M for CVS
