Placeholder so update -P doesn't remove this directory.

Used to be necessary when lib wasn't correctly automatically created.  

Now necessary because CVS expects the directory to either not exist, or
exist with a CVS subdirectory.  It finds a directory without a CVS
subdirectory because the update removes it, then a make install creates it.

Simply removing the lib directory from the repository would mean ancient
versions of L2 won't compile.
